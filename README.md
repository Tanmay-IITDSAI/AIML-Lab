# AIML-Lab

The working of our code is in the file IHWP.ipynb

We assess a video and note down the details of vehicles which cross the road when the line is red.
Their details are stored in a mysql database, which can be accessed by writing a command in English, which will be converted into SQL by an LLM integrated into the application.

execute app.py and open localhost to give commands to llm which will output sql which will be used to print the contents of the table
