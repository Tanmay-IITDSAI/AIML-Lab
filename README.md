# AIML-Lab

The working of our code is in the file IHWP.ipynb

We assess a video and note down the details of vehicles which cross the road when the line is red.
Their details are stored in a mysql database, which can be accessed by writing a command in English, which will be converted into SQL by an LLM integrated into the application.
